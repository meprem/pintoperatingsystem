/*
The global variable jiffies holds the number of ticks that have occurred since the system booted. On boot, the kernel initializes the variable to zero, and it is incremented by one during each timer interrupt. Thus, because there are HZ timer interrupts in a second, there are HZ jiffies in a second. The system uptime is therefore jiffies/HZ seconds.

The Etymology of the Jiffy

The origin of the term jiffy is unknown. Phrases such as in a jiffy are thought to originate from eighteenth-century England. In lay terms, jiffy refers to an indeterminate but very brief period of time.

In scientific applications, jiffy represents various intervals of time, most commonly 10ms. In physics, a jiffy is sometimes used to refer to the time it takes for light to travel some specific distance (usually a foot or a centimeter or across a nucleon).

In computer engineering, a jiffy is often the time between two successive clock cycles. In electrical engineering, a jiffy is the time to complete one AC (alternating current) cycle. In the United States, this is 1/60 of a second.

In operating systems, especially Unix, a jiffy is the time between two successive clock ticks. Historically, this has been 10ms. As we have seen in this chapter, however, a jiffy in Linux can have various values.

The jiffies variable is declared in <linux/jiffies.h> as

extern unsigned long volatile jiffies;


In the next section, we will look at its actual definition, which is a bit peculiar. For now, let's look at some sample kernel code. The following code converts from seconds to a unit of jiffies:

(seconds * HZ)


Likewise, this code converts from jiffies to seconds:

(jiffies / HZ)

The jiffies variable has always been an unsigned long, and therefore 32 bits in size on 32-bit architectures and 64-bits on 64-bit architectures. With a tick rate of 100, a 32-bit jiffies variable would overflow in about 497 days. With HZ increased to 1000, however, that overflow now occurs in just 49.7 days! If jiffies were stored in a 64-bit variable on all architectures, then for any reasonable HZ value the jiffies variable would never overflow in anyone's lifetime.




Donâ€™t worry about the possibility of timer values overflowing. Timer values are
expressed as signed 64-bit numbers, which at 100 ticks per second should be
good for almost 2,924,712,087 years. By then, we expect Pintos to have been
phased out of the CS 3204 curriculum.
